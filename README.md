## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project provides a complete workflow:

- **Download** and extract dataset  
- **Preprocess** into structured DataFrames  
- **Train** a machine learning model  
- **Evaluate** model performance  
- **Generate** final predictions  

Perfect for rapid experimentation and deployment.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Steps for Training and Evaluation:

1. get data: `download_data.py`
2. create DataFrames: `preprocess_data.py`
3. training: `train.py`
4. evaluation: `evaluate.py`
5. final predictions: `create_sample.py`

Run the predict.py on the challenge dataset created by your classifier by the final preictions:


Make sure to extract the data_reid folder inside the data folder
